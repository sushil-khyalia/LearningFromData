Problem 1:

2Me^(-2(epsilon)^2*N) =< 0.03
2*e^(-2*0.05*0.05*N) =< 0.03/M
e^(-2*0.05*0.05*N) =< 0.015
-2*0.05*0.05*N =< ln(0.015)
2*0.05*0.05*N >= -ln(0.015)
N >= -ln(0.015/M)/0.005

M = 1

N >= -ln(0.015)/0.005
N >= 840

Answer : [b]

Problem 2:

N >= -ln(0.0015)/0.005
N >= 1301

Answer : [c]

Problem 3:

N >= -ln(0.00015)/0.005
N >= 1761

Answer : [d]

Problem 4:

In any 5 point hypothesis if we have same sign on the opposite sides of plane formed by the 3 points of different sign we cannot break them with any perceptron model in R3.

Answer : [b]

Problem 5:

The growth function is either 2^N or a polynomial in N so (i), (ii) and (v) are the only possible growth functions.

Answer : [b]

Problem 6:

As we have only +ve intervals the hypothesis set will have a break point when we have the smallest number of elements with 3 or more + ve intervals.
This occurs when number of elements is 5 and the hypothesis missing will be +1, -1, +1, -1, +1.

Answer : [c]

Problem 7:

Choose four places out of N+1 gaps formed by N points. This will correspond to one way.
Also if elements are only from one of the arbitarily chosen intervals. Then choose 2 points out of the N+1 gaps. This will correspond to one way.
Also case when all are -1.

So total equals (N+1)C4 + (N+1)C2 + 1

Answer : [c]

Problem 8:

As done in 6 choose a minimal number of points in which we can have M+1 +ve intervals.
This occurs when number of elements is 2M+1 and the hypothesis missing will be +1,-1,+1 ....,-1,+1.

Answer : [d]

Problem 9:

1,3 can be shattered easily by a triangle.
5 points can be shattered in the case of a convex pentagon.
0,1,4,5 +1 can be shown easily. For 2 +1 create a triangle with one side as line joining the 2 +1 and having a negligible height.
For 3 +1 create a triangle with these 3 points.

For 7 points if we have a convex polygon formed by them. The case where 3 adjacent vertices and one other vertex +1 is not possible.
If they form a concave polygon then the case where the vertex coming inside is -1 and rest are +1 is not possible.

So 7 points cannot be shattered by the triangle learning model.

Answer : [d]

Problem 10:

It is the same case interval in a linear case and has the growth function equal to (N+1)C2 + 1.

Answer : [b]
