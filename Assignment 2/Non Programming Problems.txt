Problem 2 :

c1 and c_rand both have same distribution in each iteration and hence they follow Hoeffding Inequality.

Answer : [d]

Problem 3:

Wrong output comes when one of target function or hypothesis gives wrong output while other one gives correct output.
P(wrong) = mu*lambda + (1-lambda)*(1-mu)

Answer : [e]

Problem 4:

P(wrong) = 1 - lambda - mu(1 - 2*lambda)
For it to be independent of mu 1-2*lambda = 0 or lambda = 0.5

Answer : [b]
